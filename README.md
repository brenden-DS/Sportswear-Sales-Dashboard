# Sportswear Sales Dashboard


### Overview/Context:
- This project analyzes sportswear product sales across regions, sales channels, and retailers from 2020 to 2021, aiming to identify performance trends, highlight areas for improvement, and uncover opportunities to enhance sales. The analysis was fully conducted in Power BI, which was used for data processing and analysis. An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to present the findings: [Link](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiOTU2MWE4YzAtNjU3Mi00NzIxLWJhODMtODZmYzlmYzgwOGUzIiwidCI6IjAzNWEyYzY4LTc2YjQtNGViYS1hMTVhLWNiYmNhOTY4NjhjZCJ9)

  
### Dataset:
- The dataset comprises sales records with the following features: City, Invoice Date, Operating Margin, Operating Profit, Price per Unit, Product, Region, Retailer, Retailer ID, Sales Method, State, Total Sales, and Units Sold. It spans a two-year period (2020–2021), capturing transactions across various sales channels and regions, with total sales of $89.99 million and 2.48 million units sold.

  
### Data Preprocessing:
- Data cleaning was performed within Power BI using Power Query. Steps included handling missing values through removal, eliminating duplicate entries, and 
  standardizing date formats to ensure consistency across the dataset for accurate analysis.
  
### Business Questions:  
- What are the total sales and units sold over the analysis period?  

- How do sales vary by season, sales channel, and region?  

- Which retailers and products are top performers, and which are underperforming?  

- What are the sales trends across different states?  

- How can sales performance be improved in low-performing areas?
